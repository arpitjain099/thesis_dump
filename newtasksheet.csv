Rate the sentiment expressed in the comment for this book,7,,,,"Worst Book Ever. A high-class girl who seems to run-out-of guy-friends accidentally meets a guy filled with lust. That's all there is to know about this book. Being a Chetan Bhagat follower, I was really looking forward for this book because the previous book Revolution 2020 was very much different. Thoroughly disappointed with this book though. Save your money and go for some other book.",half girlfriend,,,,

Rate the sentiment expressed in the comment for this book,7,,,,"I have read all of Chetan Bhagat's books and I hate to admit that it is the worst. Out of 260 pages, 180 pages are worthless; the interesting portions lie in 70 pages after that and again last 10 pages are boring. Also, He has not worked on development of main characters. The girl appears to be broken and thus, reclusive while the boy is a sick, pushy psycho who needs a kick in the shin. I read this book from cover to cover in 4 hours and I feel sorry for the wasted time.",half girlfriend,,,,

Rate the sentiment expressed in the comment for this book,7,,,,"There are so many 5 and 4 star reviews for this book. But, I did not find it that interesting. The engrossment quotient is fine in the first half, but the second half gets really boring and obvious. The chapter that leads to the climax is unexpected and interesting, however, once you are done with that chapter, you almost know what you will find in rest of the 6 to 8 chapters. This makes it even more boring in the end.",half girlfriend,,,,
Rate the sentiment expressed in the comment for this book,7,,,,"I guess this book cannot even qualify as a promotional brochure for IIM-A . The book is poorly written , with no consistency in writing styles or language (all of these are bad though) and does not even motivation at all. I think very motivated people can actually run away from becoming entrepreneurs by reading this book . The book is so monotonous and boring that I could hardly read even 1/3rd of it. The author has no idea about how to go about writing the book and allowing the person being interviewed to tell the story and come out of its shell. Author keeps on wandering on the same theme and same track in all chapters- I guess too lazy and maybe even a common questionnaire was send to all people being interviewed. All in all - DONT buy this book .",Stay hungry stay foolish,,,,

I always want to touch it haha. The bad thing is when I got it it didn't come with a charger only a usb cable. I had to use my old charger from my old phone to charge it. I was hoping to get a new charger. Other bad thing that I found out is that they don't have Chinese input on the settings. How am I suppose to write chinese?!!! So,Disappointed. That's about it for me everything else is perfect!",Samsung Moto g,,,,
