half girlfriend,,,
,+ACI-Worst Book Ever. A high+AC0-class girl who seems to run+AC0-out+AC0-of guy+AC0-friends accidentally meets a guy filled with lust. That's all there is to know about this book. Being a Chetan Bhagat follower, I was really looking forward for this book because the previous book Revolution 2020 was very much different. Thoroughly disappointed with this book though. Save your money and go for some other book.+ACI-,,50
,all respect and faith i kept on chetan losses totally in a single day after i reading this book. he writing story for bollywood or what? totally useless. i cant keep quiet and my blood pressure is increasing more and more. since it is social so im not using any harsh words. i cant tolerate yaar. now im in mood to kill any of my dear ones or drink more and die. many used to say chetan writes for youth of india. is this indian youth needs?? pure 3rd rated bollywood masala story..........,,60
,+ACI-I have read all of Chetan Bhagat's books and I hate to admit that it is the worst. Out of 260 pages, 180 pages are worthless+ADs- the interesting portions lie in 70 pages after that and again last 10 pages are boring. Also, He has not worked on development of main characters. The girl appears to be broken and thus, reclusive while the boy is a sick, pushy psycho who needs a kick in the shin. I read this book from cover to cover in 4 hours and I feel sorry for the wasted time.+ACI-,,50
,+ACI-Seriously ??? What was that ??? So disappointing.. Half girlfriend will leave you with full madness.. Anyways.. what else can u expect.. after few pages I just kept passing by until it said +ACIAIg- the end +ACIAIg- which is the best part of the book :) . SAD +ACEAIQAh-+ACI-,,30
,+ACI-There are so many 5 and 4 star reviews for this book. But, I did not find it that interesting. The engrossment quotient is fine in the first half, but the second half gets really boring and obvious. The chapter that leads to the climax is unexpected and interesting, however, once you are done with that chapter, you almost know what you will find in rest of the 6 to 8 chapters. This makes it even more boring in the end.+ACI-,,50
Stay hungry stay foolish,,,
,+ACI-I guess this book cannot even qualify as a promotional brochure for IIM+AC0-A . The book is poorly written , with no consistency in writing styles or language (all of these are bad though) and does not even motivation at all. I think very motivated people can actually run away from becoming entrepreneurs by reading this book . The book is so monotonous and boring that I could hardly read even 1/3rd of it. The author has no idea about how to go about writing the book and allowing the person being interviewed to tell the story and come out of its shell. Author keeps on wandering on the same theme and same track in all chapters+AC0- I guess too lazy and maybe even a common questionnaire was send to all people being interviewed. All in all +AC0- DONT buy this book .+ACI-,,80
,A month ago i ordered this book from amazon an what i got a photocopied version of this book. My money got wasted as i trust amazon. And its a very disturbing and shameful this.I will not recommend to anybody to shop online books from amazon,,20

,Enjoying the phone very much,,5
,+ACI-This is the best phone I've had. I had it for about 2 years and it still works amazing+ACE- The touch screen is very smooth and it feels good. I always want to touch it haha. The bad thing is when I got it it didn't come with a charger only a usb cable. I had to use my old charger from my old phone to charge it. I was hoping to get a new charger. Other bad thing that I found out is that they don't have Chinese input on the settings. How am I suppose to write chinese?+ACEAIQAh- So,Disappointed. That's about it for me everything else is perfect+ACE-+ACI-,,45
,+ACI-It is a very good phone. The phone is not superior to Nexus 4. However, it is cheaper. It is a good quality phone. The outer shell is somewhat cheap but software and core hardware is good+ACI-,,20

Title,Summary,,
Train to Pakistan,+ACI-Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years +AC0- as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues +AC0- this is the acclaimed, internationally bestselling biography of the ultimate icon of inventiveness. Walter Isaacson tells the story of the rollercoaster life and searingly intense personality of creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies,music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written, nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.+ACI-,+ACI-
