<center> <h1>mCrowd: Incentive based mobile crowdsourcing marketplace</h1>	<hr>We present a mobile crowdsourcing based marketplace where users (requesters) can upload short, simple tasks for other users (workers) to do. <br>Workers can earn money if their responses are approved by the requester. At the same time, the requester benefits by attaining results in a fast, efficient and economical way.<hr>
<h3>Type of tasks</h3>
Given the short attention span of user using a mobile phone, the tasks need to be short, crisp and straightforward. We generally focus on data validation type of tasks which can be done quickly over mobile devices. <br>The tasks may also (optionally) involve location based tasks to make use of inbuilt sensors in smartphones. We also evaluate the possibility of using our platform to cover data collection tasks with relatively shorter burst times.<br>Certain use cases where our platform is useful are:
<ul>
	<li><center>Profanity checks in images</center></li>
	<li>Sentiment analysis of tweets</li>
	<li>Comment moderation in blogs, e-commerce based portals</li>
</ul>
